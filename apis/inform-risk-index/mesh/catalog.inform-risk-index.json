It can be used to support prioritization of preparedness and early response actions for the primary impacts of the pandemic, and identify countries where secondary impacts are likely to have the most critical humanitarian consequences. The main scope of the INFORM COVID-19 Risk Index is global and regional risk-informed resource allocation, i.e. where comparable understanding of countries’ risk is important. It cannot predict the impacts of the pandemic in individual countries.\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"European Commission, Inter-Agency Standing Committee\\\",\\\"contentType\\\":[\\\"Health\\\"],\\\"homePage\\\":\\\"https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/INFORM-Epidemic\\\",\\\"thumbnail\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"coverage\\\":[\\\"Global\\\"],\\\"format\\\":[\\\"XLSX, JSON\\\"],\\\"updates\\\":[\\\"Monthly\\\"]}\""",
