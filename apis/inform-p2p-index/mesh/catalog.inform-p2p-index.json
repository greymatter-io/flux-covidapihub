The risk score ranges from 0-10, where 10 is the highest risk. The INFORM Epidemic Risk Index was adapted to better reflect the situation of the Covid-19 pandemic. As transmission is now dominated by human-to-human transmission, the “Hazard & Exposure dimension” of the model was narrowed down to the P2P (meaning people to people) component only. The adapted version of the index is called INFORM Epidemic P2P Risk Index.\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"European Commission, Inter-Agency Standing Committee\\\",\\\"contentType\\\":[\\\"Health\\\"],\\\"homePage\\\":\\\"https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/inform-index/INFORM-Epidemic\\\",\\\"thumbnail\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"coverage\\\":[\\\"Global\\\"],\\\"format\\\":[\\\"XLSX, JSON\\\"],\\\"updates\\\":[\\\"Monthly\\\"]}\""",
